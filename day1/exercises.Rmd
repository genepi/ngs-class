# Exercises

## Task 1
Connect to our server with your username/password (ssh protocol) and navigate to /data/sample with cd `cd /data/sample`. Execute the following commands: 
* head -n 10 pg40854.txt
* wc â€“l pg40854.txt 
* grep Mendel pg40854.txt

## Task 2
The grep commands helps to find patterns in a file. Please output all lines including the following sequences: AATTCGAA or AATTCCAA 

## Task 3
Write the results from Task 1 to a file named `nachname_task2.txt`

## Task 4
Connect to our server with SSH and download [this file](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz)
to your local directory. Count the amount of nucleotides ("characters") using the `wc` command. Check `man wc` to find the correct command.
Note: Subtract the header characters (`>chr22`) to get the correct number!

## Task 5 (Bonus)
Try to execute both commands (count the characters and subtract the header) using the pipe symbol (|) 
Hint: The commands which need to be combined are `grep -v ">" chr22.fa` and `wc -m`)
