# Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis

## Overall Aim
Basic knowledge in Genetics and and Computional Biology is needed to run genetic analyses and interpret results. The goal of this course is to give students insights in both areas and present them a blueprint for large-scale studies.
