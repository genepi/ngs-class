# Exercises Pattern Search

Create a local file and copy your commands!

## Task 1
The grep commands helps to find patterns in a file. Please output all lines including the following sequences: AATTCGAA or AATTCCAA 

## Task 2
Write the results from Task 1 to a file named `nachname_task2.txt`

## Task 3
Download [this file](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz)
to your local directory using `wget`. Count the amount of nucleotides ("characters") using the `wc` command. Check `man wc` to find the correct command. Subtract the header characters (`>chr22`) to get the correct number!

## Task 4 
Try to execute both commands (count the characters and subtract the header) using the pipe symbol (`|`) 
The commands which need to be combined are `grep -v ">" chr22.fa` and `wc -m`)

## Task 5
Navigate to the folder `/opt/data/unix-tests`. There is file included called `snp150CodingDbSnp.txt.gz`. Read out the header (using zcat, head, pipe) and see what's included in the file. Explain the first 5 colums. Explanation to the columns can be found [here](http://www.noncode.org/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=795065&hgta_doSchemaDb=hg38&hgta_doSchemaTable=snp150CodingDbSnp). 
Additonally, output all coding SNPs from chr22 to a file (commands to use: zcat, pipe, grep)
