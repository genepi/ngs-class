# Exercises Unix Basics

## Task 1
Connect to our server with your username/password. From Windows, please use putty or the Windows Powershell!

## Task 2 
Create a new directory in your home directory and navigate to it. 

## Task 3
`eGFR_SNPs.csv` and `HDL_SNPs.txt` are located in the folder `genepi-teaching/ngs-bioinformatics/data/unix/snp_lookup`. 
How many lines are included in each file?

## Task 4
Grep the SNP rs13326165 and the SNP rs17173637 from `genepi-teaching/ngs-bioinformatics/data/unix/snp_lookup` and write it to a file. 

## Task 5 [can be skipped]
Now, try to find the SNPs your boss asked you. Use the `grep` command to output the lines from `eGFR_SNPs.csv`. 
As a pattern file use `HDL_SNPs.txt`. Also add the `-w` option. 
Why do we need to add `-w`? (`eGFR_SNPs.csv` and `HDL_SNPs.txt`). How many SNPs did you find? Write them to a file and copy it to Windows.

Data: `genepi-teaching/ngs-bioinformatics/data/unix/snp_lookup`
