# Exercises

## Task 4
The grep commands helps to find patterns in a file. Please output all lines including the following sequences: AATTCGAA or AATTCCAA 

## Task 5
Write the results from Task 4 to a file named `nachname_task2.txt`

## Task 6
Download [this file](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz)
to your local directory. Count the amount of nucleotides ("characters") using the `wc` command. Check `man wc` to find the correct command. Subtract the header characters (`>chr22`) to get the correct number!

## Task 7 (Bonus)
Try to execute both commands (count the characters and subtract the header) using the pipe symbol (|) 
Hint: The commands which need to be combined are `grep -v ">" chr22.fa` and `wc -m`)
