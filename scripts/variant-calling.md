# Variant Calling

## Task 1 - Use the aligned file and call variants
Checkout [freebayes](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes#usage) and call your variants. As an input the aligned file (aligned.bam) is required. Write the output to a file ending with .vcf. (freebayes <ref> <bam> > out.vcf)

## Task 2 - Learn bcftools
[Bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) are utilities for variant calling and manipulating VCFs and BCFs. Try to learn the bcftools convert command extract a region from the vcf file. 

## Task 3 - Learn three commands
Again, go to the bcftools website and learn about three bcftools commands from the "list of commands".
