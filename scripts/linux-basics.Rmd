# Exercises Unix Basics

## Task 1
Connect to our server with your username/password. From Windows, please use putty!

## Task 2 
Create a new directory in your home directory and navigate to it. 

## Task 3
`eGFRcys.csv` and `hdlsnps.csv` are located in the folder `/opt/unix-tests/teslovich`. 
How many lines are included in each file?

## Task 4
Now, try to find the SNPs your boss asked you. Use the `grep` command to output the lines from `eGFRcys.csv`. 
As a pattern file use `hdlsnps.csv`. Also add the `-w` option. 
Why do we need to add `-w`? (`eGFRcys.csv` and `hdlsnps.csv`). Write the results into the file `result.csv` located in the folder from Task 2.
