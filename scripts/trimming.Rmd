# Trimming of FASTQ

A lot of different tools exist for trimming. Easiest way is to google after "fastq trimming". Here, we present two tools:

## Installing and Executing Seqtk

Toolkit for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats

    git clone https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
    cd seqtk; make
    ./seqtk seq -A /opt/data/opt/data/fastq/LPA-Plasmid-long-50-1-LongAmp-NEB_S78_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz > test.fasta
    /opt/tools/seqtk/seqtk seq -A \ /opt/data/fastq/LPA-Plasmid-long-50-1-LongAmp-NEB_S78_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  > test.fasta
    /opt/tools/seqtk/seqtk trimfq -l 20 /opt/data/fastq/LPA-Plasmid-long-50-1-LongAmp-NEB_S78_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz \ > /opt/data/fastq-trimming/out/trimmed-seqtk.fq


## Executing FASTX and Understand the command (Student)

Try to understand the commands, execute them and alter them. 
### FASTQC Before
    /opt/tools/FastQC/fastqc /opt/data/fastq/LPA-Plasmid-long-50-1-LongAmp-NEB_S78_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz --outdir test
### FASTX
    /opt/tools/fastx/bin/fastx_trimmer -v -f 7 -l 100 -Q 33 -i /opt/data/fastq-trimming/LPA-Plasmid-long-50-1-LongAmp-NEB_S78_L001_R1_001.fastq -o /opt/data/fastq-trimming/out/trimmed-fastx.fq
### FASTQC After
    /opt/tools/FastQC/fastqc /opt/data/fastq-trimming/out/trimmed-fastx.fq --outdir test

## Execute a Quality Filter (Student)

Execute the quality-filter command (/opt/tools/fastx/bin/fastq_quality_filter) and filter reads with a quality lower then 28. Please add the command line option -Q 33. Execute the FASTQ report afterwards (as before)
